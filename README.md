To solve the problem, I used the reactjs library and bootstrap .
I installed creat-react-app , axios and http-server too.
To launch the application, you must have nodejs and npm installed in your computer.

Step 1: Open terminal and install http-server with the command: npm install http-server -g


Step 2: Open terminal and enter to the folder where the application is stored then enter in the sub folder listBook and run the command:
     http-server --cors =http://localhost:3000/


Step 3: Open another terminal window and enter to the application directory and run the command npm start
